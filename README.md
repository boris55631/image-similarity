# image-similarity
The problem of recognizing similar images is complicated to solve. What can be more complicated is to implement search among a significant amount of images within a web platform having relational database. This project solves this problem to a certain extent. With a C# console tool you can generate hashes for specified images which will be available to be stored in the database. After this, hashes may be stored into a database and be searched with a specific SQL script (Microsoft SQL Server is used in demo SQL script). If you want to know whether images are similar to each other or not, you need to compare hashes using SQL script provided in demo. Value 0.95 and higher means that images are 95%+ alike and may be considered quite similar.
